# Module6

Exercise 1
• Create a Greeting component, in its own file, which
renders the text “Hello World”.
• Import it into App.jsx, and pass in a prop called ‘name’
when rendering the Greeting component
• If the name prop exists, make sure the Greeting
component replaces ‘World’ with that name value, i.e.
“Hello John”.
• Include support for a greeting message via children.

Exercise 2
• Create a BigCats component, in its own file, which uses
the cats array (below) to display a styled list of cats.
• Include a unique id and fix the warning about keys
• Create a SingleCat component for rendering each
individual cat, and add an image property for each one.

Exercise 3
• Create an Emoji component, in its own file, which initially
renders a happy emoji.
• Add a ‘Change Mood’ button in the component to switch
between 2 emojis when clicked.

Exercise 4
• Extend your BigCats component from Exercise 2 to
include buttons for alphabetically sorting and reversing the
list
• Add another button to filter the list and display only the
cats in the ‘Panthera’ family, and one to reset and show
the full list.

Exercise 5
• Create a new AddCatForm component that renders a form
with controlled components to capture name, latinName
and image details for a new Big Cat (extending Exercises
2 and 4)
• Submitting the form should update the parent BigCats
component and re-render the list
• Add a Delete link next to each cat allowing it to be removed
from the list.

Exercise 6
• Design and create a basic Calculator component which
takes 2 numbers and the operator provided by the user and
displays the result.
